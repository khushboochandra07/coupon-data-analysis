## Findings from the analysis of acceptance coupon data

*  Coupons acceptance negatively correlates with direction of drivers.
*  Drivers going to no urgent place accepts the coupons more than others.
*  Drivers with friends tend to accept coupons more.
*  Weather plays a role in drivers accepting the coupons in general. On sunny days there is more acceptance.
*  Time is a factor in acceptance. People equally accept and reject coupons at 7AM and 10PM. Indicating that coupons are not useful around those times. 10AM, 2PM and 6PM is more favorable.
*  Cheaper restaurants and carry out coupons are more affective than others.
*  1 day expiration coupons are more affective than 2H ones.
*  Gender doesn't seem to play a role in coupon acceptance.
*  Drivers in 21~26 age group accept coupons more than others.  
*  Coupons are more affective for drivers with occupation student.
*  Drivers with income of more than 62,500 tend to equally accept and reject coupons. Drivers below that income range accept coupons more than rejecting the coupons.
*  Drivers who either frequent bars or coffee house or take carry outs or visits cheaper restaurants, 1~3 times a month accept coupons more than others.

### **Hypothesis on Drivers Who Accepted Bar Coupons**  

*   41% of the drivers accepted bar coupons. Success rate of bar coupons is less than 50%.  
*   Around 76.9% of drivers who frequents bar more than 3 times a month accepted the bar coupon. Close to half of the drivers who frequented the bar 3 or fewer times rejected the bar coupon.
*   Around 70% of the drivers over 25 years of age who frequent bar more than once a month accepted the coupons compared to all other drivers whose acceptance is 33.5%.
*   Drivers with partners and friends and who visit bar more than once a month are more likely to accept bar coupons compared to all others.
*   Drivers with partners and friends and who visit bar more than once a month and not widowed or drivers go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 are more likely to accept bar coupons compared drivers who go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 50K.

**Next steps for drivers who accepted bar coupons based on limited evidence:**
*   Targeting the coupons to drivers who frequents bar more than 3 times a month will result in better conversion of coupons.
*   Bar coupons works better when targeted to drivers over 25 years and frequent bar more than once a month.
*   Drivers with partners and friends and who visit bar more than once a month are better target for bar coupons.

### Independent Hypothesis for drivers who accepted coffee house coupons

*  49.86% of the drivers accepted coffee house coupons. Success rate of coffee house coupons is around 50%.
*  Around 67.5% of drivers who frequents coffee house more than 3 times a month accepted the coffee house coupon. 56% of the drivers who frequented the coffee house 3 or fewer times accepted the coffee house coupon. Targeting the coupons to drivers who frequents coffee house more than 3 times a month will result in better conversion of coupons.
*  Around 63.8% of the drivers over 25 years of age who frequent coffee house more than once a month accepted the coupons compared to all other drivers whose acceptance is 33.5%. coffee house coupons works better when targeted to drivers over 25 years and frequent coffee house more than once a month.
*  Drivers with partners and friends and who visit coffee house more than once a month and not in Farming Fishing & Forestry occupation are more likely to accept coffee house coupons compared to all others.
*  Weather doesn't seem to determine if the drivers accept coffee house coupons as 50% accepted coupons on sunny day and 47% accepted coupons on rainy or snowy days.

**Next steps for drivers who accepted coffee house coupons based on limited evidence:**
*   Targeting the coupons to drivers who frequents coffee house more than 3 times a month will result in better conversion of coupons.
*   Coffee house coupons works better when targeted to drivers over 25 years and frequent bar more than once a month.
*   Drivers with partners and friends and who visit bar more than once a month are better target for bar coupons.
*   Acceptance of the coupons may or moy not depend on the weather that day.
